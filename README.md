# Management-System
Real-time Task Management System with both back-end and front-end components. The system will allow users to manage tasks concurrently in real-time, utilising WebSocket for instant updates and AWS DynamoDB for data persistence.

Task-

Back-End
Technology Stack: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, AWS SDK, AWS DynamoDB,
WebSocket
1. Create a RESTful API to manage your tasks
2. Data should be stored in AWS DynamoDB
3. Implement Real-Time updates with WebSocket
4. Use Typescript throughout the backend for type safety

Front-End
Technology Stack: React, Typescript
1. Create a react component for task management
2. Implement Realtime updates with WebSocket
3. Allow users to add new tasks and update task statuses
4. use Typescript for type safety

So firstly I am going to quickly do a refresher on Restful API and quickly learn the basics of TypeScript using https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php and some relevant youtube videos which I shall add later.
